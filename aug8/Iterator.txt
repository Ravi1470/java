Iterator is a java cursor. it is used to iterate or traverse a collection object's elements one by one.

It is a universal iterator as we can apply it to any collection object. by using iterator we can perform both read and remove operations.

An iterator object can be created by callin the iterator() method present in collection interface.

Iterator itr = c.iterator();
Note: Here "c" is any collection object.

the iterator interface defines three methods as listed below;

1. hasNext() : Returns true if the iterator has more elements.

2. next() : Returns the next element in the iteration . It throws NoSuchElementException if no more element is present.

3. remove() : remove the next element in the iteration. This method can be called only once per call to next().
